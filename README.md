# rock-paper-scissors

This is my first java script project.
It is played in the terminal only!

So far I've learned how to declare variables, variable types, conditionals and functions. :D
I've also learned something about "how to think like a programmer" so I started the code off with some pseudo code.

In the updated version I've added a neet UI using DOM manipulation. I now know how to get DOM elements, add them, change theyr properties(style, text) etc. I also understand callback functions now, which are a big part of JS I've found! :D
